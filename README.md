   - Students log in using either their username/password or facial recognition.
   - Once logged in, they can view their personal information, enrolled courses, and upcoming lectures.

2. **Professors**:
   - Professors log in with their credentials or facial recognition.
   - They can create new lectures, add assignments, and manage attendance for their courses.
   - Attendance is taken using a facial recognition system to ensure accuracy.

3. **Affairs Staff**:
   - Affairs staff have complete control over the system and can:
     - Add, delete, or modify student, professor, and course data.
     - Search for specific records to retrieve detailed information.
